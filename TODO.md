* Multidimensional arrays
* INPUT, multiple variables, different types (not just string)
* tokenizer might not work for programs with no spaces like superstartrek.bas
* GOSUB how will that work?
* IF THEN statements can have multiple statements in the "THEN" block
* boolean expressions are only valid in IF clause I think. So can tell when "=" should mean "=="
* The conversion to tokenlist doesn't preserve whitespace
